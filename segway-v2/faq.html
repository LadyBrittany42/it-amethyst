    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>Speed</h3>
       <p> Concept Centaur prototypes have gone just over 20 miles per hour. If Concept Centaur were to be manufactured in the future, more 
          testing would be required to determine the appropriate top speed.</p>
         
      <h3>Cost</h3>
        <p>Since Concept Centaur is just that a concept they aren't for sale. At the present time, Segway Inc. has no plans to manufacture 
          or sell this as a product.</p>
