    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><h3>How fast does it go?</h3></dt>
        <dd>Concept Centaur prototypes have gone just over 20 miles per hour. If Concept Centaur were to be manufactured in the future, more 
          testing would be required to determine the appropriate top speed.</dd>
      <dt><h3>How much does it cost?</h3></dt>
        <dd>Since Concept Centaur is just that�a concept�they aren't for sale. At the present time, Segway Inc. has no plans to manufacture 
          or sell this as a product.</dd> 
      <dt><h3>When will it be available?</h3></dt>
        <dd>At present time, Segway Inc. has no plans to manufacture the Centaur. All new Segway products will be posted to our website as 
        they are released. If you'd like, you may send an e-mail to tswallace@ualr.edu and include your name, address, and phone number to be
